# project-automation

Whats the idea ? . . . 
The idea / motivation behind the project is to create the architecture of a enterprise project with various embedded functionalities in matter of seconds / minutes.

Is it required ?
Well this all depend on your use case , In our case we have to continously create projects with same functionalities , like alfresco , jasper , shiro and functionalities like these are always required to be present in every project . So to integrate them our developers commit a time frame of around 1 month to create the basic initial structure which is definately a waste of time . Using automation we can give this advantage to our developers whereby they have some extra time to spend on there own stuff , research and development of critical issues, faster development cycle.

What it basically is ? 
Maven based project which will reduce project creation time in organisations from months down to few minutes
